# Data-Analyst-Practice
My daily learning and practice as I build skills in Python, SQL, R, and data analysis.

Each folder includes:
- **problems.py** → modular, well-documented Python scripts  
- **solutions.ipynb** → executed notebook with outputs for clarity  
- **notes.md** → concise summary of concepts, insights, and takeaways
